# Interfacing with Arduino - Ultrasonic Sensor
The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor uses SONAR to determine the distance of an object just like the bats do. It offers excellent non-contact range detection with high accuracy and stable readings in an easy-to-use package from 2 cm to 400 cm or 1‚Äù to 13 feet.

- connect GND pin on sensor with GND of arduino
- connect VCC pin on sensor with 5V pin of Arduino
- connect Trigger Pin of sensor with D7
- connect Echo Pin of sensor with D6

Theoratically this code should work with any Arduino. I have tested in Arduino Mega
